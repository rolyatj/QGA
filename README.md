Frontend (React - JavaScript)

	•	Components: React components for each feature of the application.
	•	State Management: Utilizes React state and props for interactivity.
	•	API Integration: Axios for backend communication.

Syntax Example:

// GolfCourseList.js
import React from 'react';

function GolfCourseList() {
  // Component logic
}

iOS (SwiftUI & ARKit - Swift)

	•	Views: SwiftUI views for various app features.
	•	AR Integration: ARKit for shot tracking feature.
	•	Networking: Alamofire for API communication.

Syntax Example:

// ShotTrackerView.swift
import SwiftUI

struct ShotTrackerView: View {
  // SwiftUI view for shot tracking
}
